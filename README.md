## Problem Statement 

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) was established in 2005. It is an EU agency aimed at strengthening Europe's defenses against infectious diseases. The core functions cover a wide spectrum of activities such as surveillance, epidemic intelligence, public health training, international relations, health communication, and etc. One interesting function is the vaccine-preventable diseases such as Measles and Rubella. 

Measles is an acute, highly contagious viral disease capable of causing epidemics. Infectivity is close to 100% in susceptible individuals and in the pre-vaccine era measles would affect nearly every individual during childhood. Immunization has dramatically reduced the incidence of measles in Europe but despite overall high immunization coverage, measles continues to cause frequent outbreaks. Globally, measles remains a leading cause of childhood deaths and an estimated 160,000 children die each year from complications of the disease. 

By looking at historical surveillance data in the European countries, can we build a time series model and predict when the next Measles Outbreaks would most likely occur? The objective is to detect Outbreaks earlier and aim to ensure timely responses to take appropriate public health measures. It is important detect outbreaks early on, especially since measles is a vaccine-preventable disease and childhood deaths can often be prevented. The goal of this project to develop a predictive model to forecast Measles Outbreaks and in like every time series models, we can use mean squared error to evaluate our model.


## Executive Summary 

The ECDC publishes a monthly surveillance report on measles and rubella data submitted by the 30 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries in the ECDC Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases. The routine disease data are submitted on a monthly basis by 30 EU/EEA countries and the data for this project was collected through the Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases through the following [link](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/measles/surveillance-and-disease-data/atlas). 

After obtaining the [CSV files](https://github.com/Preeya0225/capstone_project/tree/master/data), the data was cleaned by checking for duplicates, missing values and different data types and be found in this [Notebook](./code/1_data_cleaning.ipynb). After the cleaning process, the data was then saved into a new CSV file.

In [Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook](./code/2_eda.ipynb) the Measles Outbreaks data was analyzed by looking into each specific country of the 30 EU/EEA countries. During EDA shown in the plot below, Measles Outbreaks in Germany occurred most frequently from 2000 - 2019 and seemed to be the most suited country for predicting Measles Outbreaks over time. Selecting Germany as our target country for predictions to further continue to our next step, Modeling.

During [Modeling](./code/3_modeling.ipynb) the data was preprocessed and then used to predict Outbreaks in Germany with an ARIMA and SARIMAX time series models. 
The SARIMAX, also known as Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors model, resulted in approx. 3000 Mean Squared Error, which was the best model with the minimum Mean Squared Errors compared to our other models.

<!-- ECDC's Mission: 
 According to Article 3 of the Founding Regulation, ECDC's mission is to identify, assess and communicate current and emerging threats to human health posed by infectious diseases. In order to achieve this mission, ECDC works in partnership with national health protection bodies across Europe to strengthen and develop continent-wide disease surveillance and early warning systems. By working with experts throughout Europe, ECDC pools Europe's health knowledge to develop authoritative scientific opinions about the risks posed by current and emerging infectious diseases. -->
